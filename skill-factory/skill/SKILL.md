# Skill Factory

**Autonomous skill creation - just tell me what you need, I'll handle everything.**

## What This Does

You request a skill, I deliver a production-ready skill with guaranteed quality (score >= 8.0/10).

**No decision-making required. No tool selection. No quality checking. Just results.**

### Anthropic's Official Best Practices

For comprehensive guidance on creating effective skills, see:

- **[references/overview.md](references/overview.md)** - Complete overview of Agent Skills architecture, progressive disclosure, and how Skills work across different platforms (API, Claude Code, Agent SDK, claude.ai)
- **[references/quickstart.md](references/quickstart.md)** - Quick tutorial on using pre-built Agent Skills in the Claude API with practical code examples
- **[references/best-practices.md](references/best-practices.md)** - Detailed authoring best practices including core principles, skill structure, progressive disclosure patterns, workflows, evaluation strategies, and common patterns
- **[references/anthropic-best-practices.md](references/anthropic-best-practices.md)** - Quality scoring system (10/10 criteria) used by skill-factory

These references provide Anthropic's official guidance and are consulted during the quality assurance phase.

## Usage

Simply describe the skill you need:

```
"Create a skill for Anchor development with latest docs and best practices"
"Create a React skill from react.dev with comprehensive examples"
"Create a skill for Solana transaction debugging workflows"
"Create a skill for writing technical documentation following company standards"
```

**I will automatically:**
1. ✅ Analyze your request
2. ✅ Select the optimal creation method
3. ✅ Create the skill
4. ✅ Run quality assurance loops (until score >= 8.0)
5. ✅ Test with automated scenarios
6. ✅ Deliver ready-to-use skill with stats

## What You Get

```
✅ anchor-development skill ready!

📊 Quality Score: 8.9/10 (Excellent)

Try it: "How do I create an Anchor program?"
```

## How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

### Phase 1: Request Analysis (Automatic)

I analyze your request to determine:

**Source Detection:**
- Documentation URL/mention? → Automated scraping path
- "Latest docs", "current version"? → Automated path
- GitHub repository mention? → Automated path
- PDF/manual path? → Automated path
- Custom workflow/process description? → Manual TDD path
- Both documentation AND custom needs? → Hybrid path

**Quality Requirements Extraction:**
- "Best practices" → Enforce quality gates
- "Latest version" → Scrape current docs
- "Examples" → Ensure code samples included
- "Comprehensive" → Verify coverage completeness

### Phase 2: Execution (Automatic)

**Path A: Documentation-Based (Skill_Seekers)**
```
Detected: Documentation source available
Method: Automated scraping with quality enhancement

Steps I take:
1. Check Skill_Seekers installation (install if needed)
2. Configure scraping parameters automatically
3. Run scraping with optimal settings
4. Monitor progress
5. Initial quality check
6. If score < 8.0: Run enhancement loop
7. Re-score until >= 8.0
8. Test with auto-generated scenarios
9. Package and deliver
```

**Path B: Custom Workflows (Manual TDD)**
```
Detected: Custom workflow/process
Method: Test-Driven Documentation (obra methodology)

Steps I take:
1. Create pressure test scenarios
2. Run baseline (without skill)
3. Document agent behavior
4. Write minimal skill addressing baseline
5. Test with skill present
6. Identify rationalizations/gaps
7. Close loopholes
8. Iterate until bulletproof
9. Package and deliver
```

**Path C: Hybrid**
```
Detected: Documentation + custom requirements
Method: Scrape then enhance

Steps I take:
1. Scrape documentation (Path A)
2. Identify gaps vs requirements
3. Fill gaps with TDD approach (Path B)
4. Unify and test as whole
5. Quality loop until >= 8.0
6. Package and deliver
```

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance Loop (Automatic)

**I enforce Anthropic best practices:**

```python
while quality_score < 8.0:
    issues = analyze_against_anthropic_guidelines(skill)

    if "vague_description" in issues:
        improve_description_specificity()

    if "missing_examples" in issues:
        extract_or_generate_examples()

    if "too_long" in issues:
        apply_progressive_disclosure()

    if "poor_structure" in issues:
        reorganize_content()

    quality_score = rescore()
```

**Quality Criteria (Anthropic Best Practices):**
- ✅ Description: Specific, clear, includes when_to_use
- ✅ Conciseness: <500 lines OR progressive disclosure
- ✅ Examples: Concrete code samples, not abstract
- ✅ Structure: Well-organized, clear sections
- ✅ Name: Follows conventions (lowercase, hyphens, descriptive)

**Important**: The quality assurance process consults [references/best-practices.md](references/best-practices.md) for Anthropic's complete authoring guidelines and [references/anthropic-best-practices.md](references/anthropic-best-practices.md) for the 10-point scoring criteria.

### Phase 4: Testing (Automatic)

**I generate and run test scenarios:**

```python
# Auto-generate test cases from skill content
test_cases = extract_key_topics(skill)

for topic in test_cases:
    query = f"How do I {topic}?"

    # Test WITHOUT skill (baseline)
    baseline = run_query_without_skill(query)

    # Test WITH skill
    with_skill = run_query_with_skill(query)

    # Verify improvement
    if not is_better(with_skill, baseline):
        identify_gap()
        enhance_skill()
        retest()
```

### Phase 5: Delivery (Automatic)

```
Package skill:
- Create skill directory structure
- Generate SKILL.md with frontmatter
- Create reference files (if using progressive disclosure)
- Add examples directory
- Create .zip for easy upload
- Install to ~/.claude/skills/ (if desired)
- Generate summary statistics
```

## Quality Guarantee

**Every skill delivered by skill-factory:**
- ✅ Scores >= 8.0/10 on Anthropic best practices
- ✅ Has concrete examples (not abstract)
- ✅ Follows structure conventions
- ✅ Tested with auto-generated scenarios
- ✅ Ready to use immediately

**If quality < 8.0, I keep working until it reaches 8.0+**

## Troubleshooting

**Skill_Seekers installation fails:**
```bash
# Manual installation
git clone https://github.com/yusufkaraaslan/Skill_Seekers ~/Skill_Seekers
cd ~/Skill_Seekers
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or use installation script
~/Projects/claude-skills/skill-factory/skill/scripts/install-skill-seekers.sh
```

**Quality score stuck below 8.0:**
- I'll report what's blocking and suggest manual review
- Check references/anthropic-best-practices.md for criteria
- Run manual enhancement if needed

**Want to understand methodology:**
- See references/obra-tdd-methodology.md (testing approach)
- See references/anthropic-best-practices.md (quality criteria)
- See references/skill-seekers-integration.md (automation details)

- Check quality manually
- Test with subagents yourself
- Wonder if output is good

**You want to:**
- Describe what you need
- Get high-quality result
- Start using immediately

**That's what skill-factory delivers.**
