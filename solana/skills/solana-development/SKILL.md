# Solana Development

Build Solana programs using Anchor framework or native Rust. Both approaches share the same core concepts (accounts, PDAs, CPIs, tokens) but differ in syntax and abstraction level.

## Quick Start

### Recommended: Anchor Framework

Anchor provides macros and tooling that reduce boilerplate and increase developer productivity:

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("YourProgramID");

#[program]
pub mod my_program {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>, data: u64) -> Result<()> {
        ctx.accounts.account.data = data;
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    #[account(init, payer = user, space = 8 + 8)]
    pub account: Account<'info, MyAccount>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

#[account]
pub struct MyAccount {
    pub data: u64,
}
```

**When to use Anchor:**
- Building DeFi, NFT, or standard programs
- Need TypeScript client generation with IDL
- Want faster development with less boilerplate
- Following common Solana patterns
- New to Solana development

**Installation:**
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --locked --force
avm install latest
avm use latest
anchor --version
```

**Create project:**
```bash
anchor init my_project
cd my_project
anchor build
anchor test
```

**→ See [references/anchor.md](references/anchor.md) for complete Anchor guide**

### Advanced: Native Rust

Native Rust provides maximum control, optimization potential, and deeper understanding of Solana's runtime:

```rust
use solana_program::{
    account_info::AccountInfo,
    entrypoint,
    entrypoint::ProgramResult,
    pubkey::Pubkey,
    msg,
};

entrypoint!(process_instruction);

pub fn process_instruction(
    program_id: &Pubkey,
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    instruction_data: &[u8],
) -> ProgramResult {
    msg!("Processing instruction");
    // Manual account parsing and validation
    // Manual instruction routing
    Ok(())
}
```

**When to use Native Rust:**
- Need maximum compute efficiency (CU optimization critical)
- Require advanced features (versioned transactions, durable nonces, ALTs)
- Learning Solana fundamentals from first principles
- Building highly optimized or specialized programs
- Framework overhead is unacceptable

**Setup:**
```bash
cargo new my_program --lib
cd my_program
# Configure Cargo.toml (see native-rust.md)
cargo build-sbf
```

## Decision Guide

| Your Need | Recommended Approach | Reason |
|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| Standard DeFi/NFT program | Anchor | Faster development, proven patterns |
| TypeScript client needed | Anchor | Auto-generates IDL and client types |
| Learning Solana fundamentals | Native Rust first | Understand the platform deeply |
| Compute optimization critical | Native Rust | Direct control, minimal overhead |
| Advanced tx features (ALTs, nonces) | Either (slight edge to Native) | Framework-agnostic features |
| Fast prototyping | Anchor | Less boilerplate, faster iteration |
| Maximum control over every detail | Native Rust | No abstraction layer |
| Team familiar with frameworks | Anchor | Lower learning curve |
| Program size matters | Native Rust | Smaller compiled programs |

**Note:** You can also start with Anchor for rapid development, then optimize critical paths with native Rust patterns if needed.

## Framework Comparison

| Aspect | Anchor | Native Rust |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Setup complexity** | Simple (`anchor init`) | Manual (Cargo.toml, entrypoint) |
| **Boilerplate** | Minimal (macros handle it) | Significant (manual everything) |
| **Account validation** | Declarative (`#[account(...)]`) | Manual (explicit checks) |
| **Serialization** | Automatic (Borsh via macros) | Manual (Borsh or custom) |
| **Type safety** | High (compile-time checks) | High (but more verbose) |
| **IDL generation** | Automatic | Manual or tools |
| **Client library** | TypeScript + Rust auto-gen | Manual client code |
| **Testing** | `anchor test`, Mollusk | Mollusk, cargo test |
| **Deployment** | `anchor deploy` | `solana program deploy` |
| **Compute overhead** | Small (~1-3% typical) | None (direct) |
| **Program size** | Slightly larger | Smaller |
| **Learning curve** | Gentler (abstractions help) | Steeper (need SVM knowledge) |
| **Debugging** | Good (clear macro errors) | More complex (lower level) |
| **Community** | Large (most use Anchor) | Growing (optimization focus) |

## Typical Development Workflow

### Anchor Workflow

1. **Init**: `anchor init my_project`
2. **Define accounts**: Use `#[derive(Accounts)]` with constraints
3. **Implement instructions**: Write functions in `#[program]` module
4. **Define state**: Use `#[account]` macro for account structures
5. **Test**: Write tests in `tests/`, run `anchor test`
6. **Deploy**: `anchor deploy` to configured network
7. **Client**: Import generated IDL and types in TypeScript/Rust

### Native Rust Workflow

1. **Setup**: `cargo new my_program --lib`, configure Cargo.toml
2. **Define entrypoint**: Implement `process_instruction` function
3. **Define state**: Manual Borsh serialization structs
4. **Implement instructions**: Manual routing and account parsing
5. **Validate accounts**: Explicit ownership, signer, writable checks
6. **Test**: Write Mollusk tests, run `cargo test`
7. **Build**: `cargo build-sbf`
8. **Deploy**: `solana program deploy target/deploy/program.so`
9. **Client**: Build client manually or use web3.js/rs

## Best Practices

### General (Both Approaches)

✅ **Always validate accounts**: Check ownership, signers, mutability
✅ **Use checked arithmetic**: `.checked_add()`, `.checked_sub()`, etc.
✅ **Test extensively**: Unit tests, integration tests, edge cases
✅ **Handle errors gracefully**: Return descriptive errors
✅ **Document your code**: Explain account requirements and constraints
✅ **Version your programs**: Plan for upgrades and migrations
✅ **Use PDAs for program-owned accounts**: Don't pass private keys
✅ **Minimize compute units**: Profile and optimize hot paths
✅ **Add security.txt**: Make it easy for researchers to contact you

### Anchor-Specific

✅ **Use `InitSpace` derive**: Auto-calculate account space
✅ **Prefer `has_one` constraints**: Clearer than custom constraints
✅ **Use `Program<'info, T>`**: Validate program accounts in CPIs
✅ **Emit events**: Use `emit!` for important state changes
✅ **Group related constraints**: Keep account validation readable

### Native Rust-Specific

✅ **Use `next_account_info`**: Safe account iteration
✅ **Cache PDA bumps**: Store bump in account, use `create_program_address`
✅ **Zero-copy when possible**: 50%+ CU savings for large structs
✅ **Minimize logging**: Especially avoid pubkey formatting (expensive)
✅ **Build verifiable**: Use `solana-verify build` for production

## Security Considerations

**Both frameworks require security vigilance:**

⚠️ **Common vulnerabilities:**
- Missing signer checks
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Account confusion attacks
- PDA substitution
- Arbitrary CPI targets
- Missing account ownership checks
- Insufficient rent exemption
- Account closing without zeroing

**→ For defensive programming patterns and secure coding practices, see [security.md](references/security.md)**

That guide provides:
- Core security rules and principles
- Account validation patterns
- Arithmetic safety guidelines
- Pre-deployment security checklist

**→ For comprehensive security audits, use the `solana-security` skill**

That skill provides:
- Systematic vulnerability analysis
- Attack scenarios and exploit POCs
- Framework-specific security reviews
- Professional audit workflows

## When to Switch or Combine

**Start with Anchor, optimize later:**
- Build MVP with Anchor for speed
- Profile to find CU bottlenecks
- Optimize critical paths with native patterns
- Keep Anchor for non-critical code

**Start with Native, add Anchor features:**
- Build core program logic in native Rust
- Use Anchor's client generation separately
- Leverage anchor-spl for common patterns
- Maintain control where it matters

**Use both in a workspace:**
```toml
[workspace]
members = [
    "programs/core",      # Native Rust
    "programs/wrapper",   # Anchor facade
]
```
