### Using skill-creator Tool

The official Anthropic skill-creator is available at:
`[REPO_PATH]/.claude/skills/skill-creator/`

#### Initialize New Skill

```bash
# Create new skill in the repository
python3 [REPO_PATH]/.claude/skills/skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py \
  [skill-name] \
  --path [REPO_PATH]

# This creates:
# [REPO_PATH]/[skill-name]/
# ├── SKILL.md
# ├── references/
# ├── scripts/
# └── assets/
```

#### Validate Skill

```bash
# Validate skill structure and best practices
python3 [REPO_PATH]/.claude/skills/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py \
  [REPO_PATH]/[skill-name]

# Output shows:
# - Skill validity ✅ or ❌
# - Best practices score (aim for 10.0/10)
# - Specific issues to fix
```

#### Package Skill (Optional)

```bash
# Create distributable package
python3 [REPO_PATH]/.claude/skills/skill-creator/scripts/package_skill.py \
  [REPO_PATH]/[skill-name] \
  --output ~/Downloads/
```

### skill-creator Script Details

#### 1. init_skill.py
Creates initial skill structure with proper directories.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 [REPO_PATH]/.claude/skills/skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py \
  skill-name \
  --path [REPO_PATH] \
  --description "Brief skill description"
```

**Creates:**
- SKILL.md with proper frontmatter template
- references/ directory for detailed docs
- scripts/ directory for helper utilities
- assets/ directory for templates/examples

#### 2. quick_validate.py
Validates skill against Anthropic best practices.

**Checks:**
- ✅ SKILL.md has proper frontmatter (name, description)
- ✅ Description includes trigger keywords
- ✅ SKILL.md is concise (<500 lines recommended)
- ✅ Uses progressive disclosure (references/)
- ✅ Contains concrete examples
- ✅ Has clear structure
- ✅ No anti-patterns

**Best Practices Score:**
- 10.0/10: Perfect ✅
- 8.0-9.9: Good, minor improvements
- 6.0-7.9: Acceptable, needs work
- <6.0: Does not meet standards ❌

#### 3. package_skill.py
Creates .zip package for distribution.

**Output:** `skill-name-vX.Y.Z.zip`

## Anthropic Best Practices for Skills

### SKILL.md Structure

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Clear, concise description with trigger keywords. Use when [scenarios]. Triggers on phrases like "keyword1", "keyword2", or file patterns like *.config.ts.
---

# Skill Title

Brief overview of what this skill helps with.

## When to Use This Skill

- Scenario 1
- Scenario 2
- Scenario 3

## Quick Start Workflow

1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

## Core Concepts

### Concept 1
Brief explanation with minimal code example.

### Concept 2
Brief explanation with minimal code example.

## Advanced Topics

For detailed information, see reference files:
- **Topic 1**: See `references/topic1.md` for detailed guide
- **Topic 2**: See `references/topic2.md` for comprehensive reference

## Resources

- Official Docs: [link]
- GitHub: [link]
```

### Progressive Disclosure

**Principle:** Load only what's needed for the current task.

**Structure:**
1. **Metadata (frontmatter)** - Always loaded, enables skill discovery
2. **SKILL.md** - Loaded when skill triggers (keep concise)
3. **references/*.md** - Loaded on-demand by Claude

**Example:**
```
User: "Create a simple app"
→ Loads: SKILL.md only (500 words)

User: "How do I configure advanced features?"
→ Loads: SKILL.md + references/advanced-config.md (1,500 words)

Context savings: 67%
```

### Code Examples

**Good ✅:**
```typescript
// Complete, working example
export default defineConfig({
  name: 'My App',
  version: '1.0.0',
  // Real configuration
});
```

**Bad ❌:**
```typescript
// Incomplete pseudocode
config = {
  // ... your config here
}
```

### Documentation Links

**Always link to official docs:**
```markdown
**Official Docs:** https://example.com/docs/api/feature

See the [official guide](https://example.com/guide) for more details.
```

### Trigger Keywords

**Include in description:**
- Common phrases users say
- Related technologies
- File patterns
- Use cases

**Example:**
```yaml
description: Build web apps with Vite. Use when creating frontend projects, setting up build tools, or working with modern JavaScript. Triggers on phrases like "vite project", "frontend build", or file patterns like vite.config.ts.
```

## Important Notes

### DO ✅

- **Always** validate with quick_validate.py before committing
- **Always** use up-to-date information (check sources)
- **Always** include working code examples
- **Always** link to official documentation
- **Always** use progressive disclosure pattern
- **Always** update README.md when adding skills
- **Always** focus on value-adding changes only

### DON'T ❌

- **NEVER** create unnecessary files or documentation
- **NEVER** add fluff, filler, or "water" content
- **NEVER** create summary documents unless explicitly requested
- **NEVER** write content that doesn't directly add value
- Don't include deprecated APIs or patterns

- Don't create single-file skills (use progressive disclosure)
- Don't skip validation step
- Don't commit without testing examples

### File Creation Policy

**CRITICAL:** Only create files that are absolutely necessary:
- SKILL.md (required)

- Documentation about documentation
- Any file that is not directly used by the skill or end users

### Repository-Specific Rules

1. **All skills at root level** (not nested in subdirectories)
   ```
   ✅ [REPO_PATH]/skill-name/
   ❌ [REPO_PATH]/category/skill-name/
   ```

2. **Quality over quantity** - Better to have 5 perfect skills than 20 mediocre ones

3. **Public repository** - All content will be public on GitHub
   - No proprietary code
   - No sensitive information
   - Attribution to sources

4. **Maintenance** - Keep skills current
   - Update when major versions release
   - Add notes about deprecated features
   - Remove outdated patterns
