# Crypto/Web3 Founder Guide

Specific considerations for crypto founders, with focus on Solana ecosystem (November 2025).

## Market Context (November 2025)

### Current Conditions

**Market State**
- Correction phase: BTC from $111K peak to sub-$100K
- "Extreme Fear" on sentiment indicators
- $340B market cap wipeout
- $19B in liquidations

**The Opportunity**
- Historic precedent: Extreme fear precedes major recoveries
- Companies building through volatility dominate next cycle
- Hiring strategy should be tied to execution milestones, not prices
- Your strategy should not change based on daily price action

### Funding Reality

**Strong Despite Volatility** (Sources: [Galaxy Digital](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/crypto-venture-capital-q2-2025/), [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/research))
- **$11.5B invested in crypto in 2024** across 2,153 deals (Galaxy Digital Q4 2024 Report)
- Q1 2025: ~$4.9-6B raised (range depends on inclusion of Binance's $2B strategic raise)
- Q2 2025: **$10.03B** — first quarter exceeding $10B in 3 years (since Q1 2022)
- Institutional momentum: Circle IPO, Uphold IPO exploration
- 100+ strategic M&A deals completed

**Priority Sectors by VC Evidence** (Sources: Galaxy Digital, Messari, DeFiLlama)
| Sector | Signal |
|--------|--------|
| Stablecoins/Payments | $46T transaction volume; "strong PMF" – Galaxy |
| DeFi (Solana-focused) | Multicoin "expanding Solana DeFi exposure" |
| Crypto-AI Integration | Top thesis for Pantera |
| DePIN | $3.5T projected by 2028 (Messari); Helium 1.4M daily users |
| Infrastructure/Scaling | $5.5B in 2024, 57% YoY increase (Galaxy Digital) |
| RWAs/Tokenization | $30B tokenized on-chain (DeFiLlama RWA tracker) |

**What's Declining**: Security tooling, generic interoperability, NFT speculation, enterprise blockchain.

**What VCs Want**
- Revenue-generating models over speculation
- Regulatory compliance as competitive advantage
- Sustainable unit economics
- Infrastructure plays > consumer apps

**Rob Hadick** (Dragonfly): "Don't see funding levels reaching 2021-2022 highs for a very long time." Established companies (founded ~2018) getting majority of capital; newer companies get deal count but smaller checks.

## Solana Ecosystem

### Network Performance (H1 2025)

Sources: [Solana Beach](https://solanabeach.io/), [Helius State of Solana Reports](https://www.helius.dev/blog), [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/)

- **Uptime**: 15+ months continuous (longest since launch)
- **Throughput**: 162M+ transactions daily
- **Fees**: Median <$0.01 even during peak demand

- Engage crypto-specialized lawyers
- Consider jurisdiction strategy
- Document compliance efforts
- Join industry groups (Blockchain Association)

## Go-to-Market for Crypto

### Building in Public vs. Stealth

**Community-First (Recommended for Most)**
- Build community BEFORE product launch
- Attract 100 "true fans" as foundation
- Authenticity >> marketing budget
- High-quality content + ecosystem participation

**When to Go Stealth**
- Highly competitive market with copycat risk
- Novel technology requiring IP protection
- Need quiet cycles to fix unit economics

**Hybrid (Popular)**
- Stealth dev + selective community building
- Share progress with early believers
- Launch to existing community

### Distribution Channels

**Developer Relations (Critical for Infrastructure)**
- Build tools that make developers successful
- Documentation >>> marketing
- Hackathons, workshops, tutorials
- DevRel = your growth engine

**X (Twitter) as Primary Channel**
- Founder-led narrative building
- Technical deep dives + progress updates
- Engage in ecosystem discussions
- Founder faces beat brand pages

**Progressive Disclosure**
- Don't announce until you have something to show
- Ship features, then market them
- Let users discover and evangelize

### Community as Product

**Core Principle**: Your community IS the product, not a marketing channel.

**Pre-Launch**
- Build small, dedicated group (100 true fans)
- Shared mission, not speculation
- Active ecosystem participation

**Launch**
- Reward true believers (not farmers)
- Design launch FOR your community
- Community becomes distribution

**Post-Launch**
- Turn users into owners
- Governance participation
- Co-creation of roadmap

## Revenue Models That Work

### DeFi Infrastructure

- **Transaction fees**: % of volume (DEXs, lending)
- **Spread/slippage**: Market making revenue
- **Staking fees**: 5-10% of staking rewards
- **MEV capture**: Via Jito or similar

### Payments Infrastructure

- **x402 Protocol**: Agent-to-agent payments
- **Payment rails**: Crypto-native settlement
- **B2B payments**: Stablecoin invoicing
- **Subscription models**: Recurring crypto payments

### Platform/Network Effects

- Marketplaces (take rate on transactions)
- Aggregators (fee per API call)
- Infrastructure-as-a-Service (RPC, indexing)
- Data/Analytics (subscription + API)

### What to Avoid

- Token-only value capture (no cash flow)
- Mercenary liquidity mining
- Ponzi-nomics (unsustainable yields)
- Grant-dependent (no path to sustainability)

**Key Principle**: Show path to real revenue within 12 months.

## Security & Audits

### Why Audits Are Non-Negotiable

**Historical Context**
- 2021: ~$2B lost to DeFi vulnerabilities
- 2022: Ronin ($600M), Euler ($197M)
- One exploit destroys project overnight

**What One Hack Costs**
- User funds (and trust) destroyed
- Project death
- Legal liability
- Blacklisted from future funding

### Audit Cost Breakdown

| Project Type | Cost Range | Timeline |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Simple Token | $8K - $15K | 1-2 weeks |
| DEX/AMM (Basic) | $25K - $50K | 2-4 weeks |
| Lending Protocol | $50K - $100K | 4-6 weeks |
| Complex DeFi | $100K - $150K+ | 6-8 weeks |

**Cost Factors**
- Code complexity (LOC, architecture)
- Novel mechanisms vs. battle-tested
- Firm reputation (Tier 1 = premium)
- Documentation quality
- Timeline (rush = 20-50% more)

### Top Audit Firms (Solana)

**Tier 1 ($$$)**
- Trail of Bits
- OpenZeppelin
- Halborn

**Tier 2 ($$)**
- OtterSec (Solana-native)
- Neodyme (Solana-focused)
- Sec3
- Zellic

### Cost-Saving Strategies

1. **Clean code first**: Internal review reduces scope
2. **Clear documentation**: Saves auditor time
3. **Battle-tested libraries**: Anchor, SPL standards
4. **Start small**: Audit MVP, iterate
5. **Multiple audits**: 2 smaller audits vs. 1 expensive

### Pre-Audit Checklist

- [ ] Comprehensive test suite (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Internal security review
- [ ] Clear architecture documentation
- [ ] Threat model documented
- [ ] Known issues/assumptions listed
- [ ] Testnet deployment + stress testing

**Budget Rule**: 5-10% of development budget for audits.

## Crypto-Specific Death Patterns

### Pattern 1: Building Tech Without a Problem (~30% of failures)

"Cool tech but without ever thinking if it's solving a real problem."

**Death signal**: Can't answer "Why does this need to be on-chain?" simply
**Coaching question**: "If blockchain didn't exist, how would you solve this problem?"

### Pattern 2: Token Before Product

Large premines, no economic flywheel, speculation-driven.

**Death signal**: TGE announcement before product traction metrics
**Coaching question**: "What would your product look like if you never launched a token?"

### Pattern 3: Regulatory Naïveté

No legal counsel, no token classification analysis.

**Death signal**: Launching in jurisdiction you don't understand
**Coaching question**: "Have you had a securities lawyer review your token structure?"

### Pattern 4: Ecosystem Protocol Dependency

Building on experimental chains without escape plan.

**Death signal**: Core infrastructure depends on unproven L2/protocol
**Coaching question**: "What happens if [dependency] fails or pivots? What's your exit plan?"

### Pattern 5: VC Capital Without PMF

VCs now "laser-focused on fundamentals"—funding without product-market fit is increasingly rare.

**Death signal**: Spending VC money on growth before retention metrics work
**Coaching question**: "If you couldn't raise more money, how would you get to profitability?"

### Pattern 6: The 53% Failure Rate

1.8M tokens failed in Q1 2025 alone; 52.7% of all cryptos since 2021 are "dead" ([CoinGecko Research, April 2025](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptos-failed)).

**Death signal**: No differentiation from existing solutions
**Coaching question**: "What's different about your approach that would make you survive when half of projects fail?"

### Pattern 7: Ignoring Sybil-Proofing

zkSync, Starknet heavily criticized for airdrop farmer capture.

**Death signal**: Airdrop strategy without anti-sybil measures
**Coaching question**: "How do you ensure your token distribution rewards real users, not farmers?"

### Pattern 8: Hype > Delivery

Marketing roadmap commitments you can't ship.

**Death signal**: Public promises with no technical execution plan
**Coaching question**: "Can you ship what you've promised in the next 90 days? What's blocking you?"

*Note: The following percentages are estimates based on industry post-mortems and VC analysis, not a single comprehensive study.*

### Weak Security (~25% of failures)
- Rushed smart contracts
- Skipped audits
- Result: Hacks, drained treasuries

### Overhyped Fundraising (~20% of failures)
- Raise millions without sustainable product
- Burn > runway before PMF

### Poor Community Trust (~15% of failures)
- Broken promises
- Anonymous teams that rug
- Ignored feedback

### Ignoring Compliance (~10% of failures)
- "Move fast and break things" doesn't work
- Regulatory enforcement kills projects

### Pre-Revenue Specific

- Burning cash on marketing too early
- Wrong team composition (too much biz/ops before PMF)
- Chasing hype cycles (pivoting to whatever's hot)
- Neglecting audits

## Successful Project Patterns

### Jupiter (DEX Aggregator)
- Technical excellence first
- Best execution for traders
- Clean UX rivaling CEXs
- Built reputation before token
- Community-first governance

### Drift Protocol (Perpetuals)
- First-mover advantage
- Strong technical documentation
- Active community
- Continuous iteration

### Jito (Liquid Staking + MEV)
- Solved real problem (MEV redistribution)
- Built infrastructure others depend on
- Technical credibility first
- Open-source + transparent

### Common Patterns

1. **Technical Excellence First**: Product works reliably at scale
2. **Solve Real Problem**: "Must have" not "nice to have"
3. **Community-Driven**: Users become evangelists
4. **Transparent Operations**: Regular updates, public roadmap
5. **Ecosystem Integration**: Composability with other protocols
6. **Sustainable Economics**: Real revenue, not speculation

## Treasury Management

### The Challenge
- Token-based treasuries lose value in downturns
- Fundraising dries up in bear markets
- User acquisition costs rise

### Recommended Allocation

- **50%+ Stables (USDC)**: Operational runway
- **30% Blue Chips (SOL, BTC, ETH)**: Moderate exposure
- **20% Native Token**: If applicable

### Runway Discipline

- 24-month minimum runway at all times
- Burn rate tied to milestones, not price
- Monthly financial reviews
- Scenario planning (bull/bear cases)

### Hiring Strategy

- Hire for execution milestones, not market conditions
- Pay market rates (don't "time" with low salaries)
- Equity/tokens + stables (not just tokens)
