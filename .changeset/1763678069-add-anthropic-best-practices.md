Add comprehensive Anthropic best practices documentation

- Add three new reference files: overview.md, quickstart.md, and best-practices.md
- Add "Anthropic's Official Best Practices" section to SKILL.md with links to all documentation
- Add quality assurance callout in Phase 3 referencing the best practices
- Update Reference Files section with organized categories for official docs vs implementation details
- Fix version mismatch in frontmatter (0.0.0 → 0.1.0)

These additions provide comprehensive guidance on Agent Skills architecture, progressive disclosure patterns, and authoring best practices that the skill-factory consults during quality assurance.
